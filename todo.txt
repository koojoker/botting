Workflow:
Auth bot(s) first, make sure everything is fine (DONE)
Start to log in bots (DONE)
Find to start spamming /play pit (at a 10s cd) to find the targets ign
From here on, the gui should be a constantly refreshing screen (1 fps) 
It should look like..
Bots dashboard
--------------------------------------
Bot1 - swapping lobbies... (yellow)
Bot2 - found target ($target)! (Green)
Bot3 - failed to swap lobbies... retrying in 10 seconds (red)
Bot 4 - finding target... (yellow)
Bot 5 - READY (green)
And the statuses should be refresh every second, until everyone is at ready ofc
And the user can still type in commands 
(readline) and the refreshing shouldn't reset the enter prompt too
Drop <amount> to make the number of silent bots to drop in mid and do stuff (this will be made later!!)
report <user> spam report the target user on all accounts
